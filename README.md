## User Story
AS A PC game user 
I WANT to compare reviews and pricing
SO THAT I can purchase games that best suit my interests

## Gamer aspect
As a gamer I would use this website to find a game that I seem interested in by viewing most popular or searching the games on the site. I would be able to access the reviews and the price to view the cheapest price and where to buy it. This would have helped me find where I can get a game the cheapest so I dont spend alot of money when its not needed. ðŸ™‚
